-- 1. CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS: Creates a new user if the user does not already exist.
-- 2. 'user_0d_2'@'localhost': Specifies the username and host from which the user can connect.
-- 3. IDENTIFIED BY 'user_0d_1_pwd': Sets the password for the user.
-- This command is useful for creating a new user account with a specified username, host, and password.

-- Grant all privileges on all databases and tables to the user 'user_0d_2' connecting from 'localhost'
-- and allow the user to grant these privileges to other users
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO user_0d_2@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;
-- Explanation:
-- 1. GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES: Grants all available privileges.
-- 2. ON *.*: Specifies that the privileges apply to all databases and tables.
-- 3. TO 'user_0d_2'@'localhost': Specifies the user to whom the privileges are granted.
-- 4. WITH GRANT OPTION: Allows the user to grant these privileges to other users.
-- This command is useful for granting a user full access to all databases and tables and enabling them to grant these privileges to other users.

-- Reload the grant tables to ensure that the changes take effect immediately
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- Explanation:
-- The FLUSH PRIVILEGES statement reloads the grant tables in the MySQL database server.
-- This ensures that the changes made by the GRANT statement take effect immediately.
