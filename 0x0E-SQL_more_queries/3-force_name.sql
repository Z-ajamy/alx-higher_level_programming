-- The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.
-- The IF NOT EXISTS clause ensures that the table is only created if it does not already exist.

-- Create the table 'force_name' if it does not already exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS force_name (
    id INT,                     -- Column 'id' of type INT (integer)
    name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL -- Column 'name' of type VARCHAR with a maximum length of 256 characters, and it cannot be NULL
);

-- Explanation:
-- 1. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS: Creates a new table only if it does not already exist.
-- 2. force_name: Specifies the name of the table to be created.
-- 3. id INT: Defines a column named 'id' with the data type INT, which is used for storing integer values.
-- 4. name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL: Defines a column named 'name' with the data type VARCHAR, allowing up to 256 characters.
--    - NOT NULL: Ensures that this column cannot have NULL values, meaning every row must include a value for this column.

-- Usage:
-- This command is useful for creating a table with specified columns and constraints, ensuring the table structure is defined in the database.
-- The 'IF NOT EXISTS' clause prevents errors by ensuring the table is only created if it doesn't already exist.

-- Example:
-- The resulting table will have two columns:
-- - 'id': An integer column for storing IDs.
-- - 'name': A variable character column with a maximum length of 256 characters that must contain a value (cannot be NULL).
