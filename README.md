# ALX Higher Level Programming - Project README

## Overview
This repository contains projects and assignments for the ALX Higher Level Programming track. The focus is on advancing programming skills through practical implementation and problem-solving exercises.

## Description
The ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum builds upon foundational programming concepts, introducing more complex topics and real-world applications. Students work through various programming challenges that emphasize:

- Advanced programming concepts
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Data structures and algorithms
- Web development fundamentals
- Database integration
- API development and consumption

## Technologies Used
- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **JavaScript** - Web development and scripting
- **HTML/CSS** - Front-end markup and styling
- **SQL** - Database queries and management
- **Git** - Version control and collaboration
