-- The CREATE DATABASE command creates a new database with the specified name.
-- This command ensures that a new database is created if it does not already exist.

-- Create a new database named 'hbtn_0c_0' if it does not already exist.
-- The IF NOT EXISTS clause prevents an error from occurring if the database already exists.
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `hbtn_0c_0`;

-- Explanation:
-- 1. CREATE DATABASE: This part of the command initiates the creation of a new database.
-- 2. IF NOT EXISTS: This clause ensures that the command only creates the database if it does not already exist.
-- 3. `hbtn_0c_0`: The name of the database to be created. Backticks (`) are used to enclose the database name to avoid conflicts with reserved keywords or special characters.

-- Usage:
-- This command is useful for scripts that need to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing errors or unintended side effects.

-- Example output:
-- If the database 'hbtn_0c_0' does not exist, it will be created and the server will return a confirmation message.
-- If the database already exists, the server will not create a new one and will not return an error.
