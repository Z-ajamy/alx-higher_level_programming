-- The SELECT COUNT(*) command is used to count the number of rows that match a specified condition.
-- This command is useful to determine the number of records that meet certain criteria.

-- Count the number of records in the table named 'first_table' where the 'id' column is equal to 89
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `first_table` WHERE id = 89;

-- Explanation:
-- 1. SELECT COUNT(*): This part of the command counts the number of rows that match the specified condition. The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that means "all columns," but here it is used to count rows.
-- 2. FROM `first_table`: Specifies the table from which to count the rows. The table name is enclosed in backticks to avoid conflicts with reserved keywords.
-- 3. WHERE id = 89: Adds a condition to the command to count only those rows where the 'id' column is equal to 89.

-- Usage:
-- This command is useful to find out how many records in a table meet a specific condition, which can help in data analysis and validation.

-- Example output:
-- The command returns a single row with a single column containing the count of rows that match the condition.
-- Example:
-- +----------+
-- | COUNT(*) |
-- +----------+
-- |        1 |
-- +----------+
-- The output indicates that there is one record in the table 'first_table' where the 'id' is 89.
