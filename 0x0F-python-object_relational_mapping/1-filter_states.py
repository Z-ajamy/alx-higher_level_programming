"""MySQL Database Query Script for States Starting with 'N'.

This script connects to a MySQL database and retrieves all records from
the 'states' table where the state name starts with the letter 'N' (case-sensitive),
ordered by ID. It demonstrates proper database connection handling with 
comprehensive error management and resource cleanup.

The script uses a BINARY comparison to ensure case-sensitive matching,
so only states with names starting with uppercase 'N' will be returned.

Example:
    $ python3 script.py username password database_name

Requirements:
    - MySQLdb module (MySQL-python)
    - MySQL database server running on localhost:3306
    - Database with a 'states' table containing 'id' and 'name' columns
    - Valid database credentials with SELECT permissions

    """Main execution block for filtered database query operations.
    
    This script performs the following operations:
    1. Parses command-line arguments for database connection parameters
    2. Establishes connection to MySQL database on localhost:3306
    3. Executes SELECT query to fetch states with names starting with 'N'
    4. Uses BINARY keyword for case-sensitive name matching
    5. Orders results by ID and prints each row to standard output
    6. Ensures proper cleanup of database resources
    
    Command-line Arguments:
        sys.argv[1] (str): Database username
        sys.argv[2] (str): Database password
        sys.argv[3] (str): Database name
        
    Expected Database Schema:
        Table 'states' with columns:
        - 'id': Primary key or sortable identifier
        - 'name': State name column for filtering
        
    Query Details:
        The BINARY keyword ensures case-sensitive comparison, so only
        states with names starting with uppercase 'N' are matched.
