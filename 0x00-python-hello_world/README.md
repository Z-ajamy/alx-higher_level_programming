- Who is Guido van Rossum
- Where does the name 'Python' come from
- What is the Zen of Python
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using print
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle

## Tasks

### 0. Run Python file
**Mandatory**

Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.

The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`

```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ cat main.py 
#!/usr/bin/python3
print("Best School")

guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ export PYFILE=main.py
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./0-run
Best School
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```

**File:** `0-run`

### 1. Run inline
**Mandatory**

Write a Shell script that runs Python code.

The Python code will be saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`

```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ export PYCODE='print(f"Best School: {88+10}")'
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./1-run_inline
Best School: 98
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```

**File:** `1-run_inline`

### 2. Hello, print
**Mandatory**

Write a Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.

- Use the function `print`

```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./2-print.py 
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$
```

**File:** `2-print.py`

### 3. Print integer
**Mandatory**

Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
number = 98
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
```

- You can find the source code here
- The output of the script should be:
  - the number, followed by `Battery street`
  - followed by a new line
- You are not allowed to cast the variable `number` into a string
- Your code must be 3 lines long
- You have to use f-strings

```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./3-print_number.py
98 Battery street
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```

**File:** `3-print_number.py`

### 4. Print float
**Mandatory**

Complete this source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
number = 3.14159
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
```

- You can find the source code here
- The output of the script should be:
  - `Float:` followed by the number with only 2 digits
  - followed by a new line
- You are not allowed to cast the variable `number` into a string
- You have to use f-strings

```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./4-print_float.py
Float: 3.14
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```

**File:** `4-print_float.py`

### 5. Print string
**Mandatory**

Complete this source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
str = "Holberton School"
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
```

- You can find the source code here
- The output of the script should be:
  - 3 times the value of `str`
  - followed by a new line
  - followed by the first 9 characters of `str`
  - followed by a new line
- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
- Your program should be maximum 5 lines long

```bash
