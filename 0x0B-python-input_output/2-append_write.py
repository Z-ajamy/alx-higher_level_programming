"""
Module for file appending utilities using write mode.

This module provides utilities for appending text content to files using
write mode with manual seek positioning, UTF-8 encoding, and character
count reporting.

def append_write(filename="", text=""):

    Append text content to a file using write mode with seek positioning.
    
    This function opens a file in write mode with UTF-8 encoding, seeks to
    the end of the file, and writes the specified text content. It returns
    the number of characters written. If the file doesn't exist, it will be
    created. The file is automatically closed after writing due to the use
    of a context manager (with statement).
    
    Note:
        This function uses write mode ('w') with manual seek positioning rather
        than append mode ('a'). The seek(0, 2) moves the file pointer to the
        end of the file before writing.
    
    Args:
        filename (str, optional): The path to the file to append to.
                                 Defaults to an empty string.
        text (str, optional): The text content to append to the file.
                             Defaults to an empty string.
    
    Returns:
        int: The number of characters written to the file.
    
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the directory path for the file does not exist.
        PermissionError: If there are insufficient permissions to write to
                        the file or create it in the specified location.
        IOError: If there are other I/O related errors during file operations.
        UnicodeEncodeError: If the text contains characters that cannot be
                           encoded in UTF-8 (rare, as UTF-8 supports most characters).
    
    Example:
        >>> chars_written = append_write("log.txt", "New log entry\\n")
        >>> print(chars_written)
        15
        
        >>> append_write("data.txt", "Additional data")
        15
        
        >>> append_write("empty.txt", "")
        0
